PLG_CONTENT_READLESSTEXT_DESCRIPTION="<h2>v4.1</h2><p><em>read less text</em> will control the article text: preview size, formatting and image placement can be adjusted to your liking, precisely on those pages and for those articles or items you want. <em>read less text</em> will not alter your database in any way. Only the display is controlled: uninstalling or disabling will bring back the original text.</p><p>Take your time to read all the helpful tooltips and fully configure <a href='index.php?option=com_plugins&view=plugins&filter_search=read'><em>read less text</em></a> to your liking. Use the discover mode if you need extreme flexibility in controlling which articles get shortened - and when.</p><p>This version does not affect the article&acute;s titles. If you want to control the title length, prepend or append specific information, and adjust the casing of the title, you can install and use the separate extension <a href='http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/style-a-design/titles/16619/'><em>read less title.</em></a></p>"
